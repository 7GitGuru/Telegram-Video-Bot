### To run this project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Set up a Telegram Bot:**
   - Talk to the BotFather on Telegram to create a new bot and obtain the API token.
   - Copy the API token into the `TOKEN` variable in the `main.py` file.

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
     ```
     pip install python-telegram-bot moviepy
     pip install python-telegram-bot==20.0a0
     ```

3. **Run the Bot:**
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
--- 

Please note that you need to have Python and pip installed on your system to run the bot. Additionally, make sure to replace `@username` in the code with the actual administrator's username.

This project uses the `python-telegram-bot` library for interacting with the Telegram Bot API and the `moviepy` library for video processing.
